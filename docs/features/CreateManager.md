Fees Manager	Data Manager	Academic Manager	Ops Manager	HR Manager	Custom Manager

Version 1.0  │  April 2026  │  Based on Existing Manager System (Images Reviewed)

 
1.  What Is Already Built (From Your Screenshots)
Based on the two uploaded screenshots of your Manager System page, here is an exact analysis of what is already implemented in your project. This section ensures we do NOT duplicate any existing work.

1.1  Already Built — Current Form Structure
Already Exists — Do NOT Rebuild
The Create Manager modal form is fully built with: Full Name, Email, Phone, Password fields.
Module Permissions section exists with: Manage Students, Manage Faculty, Manage Classes, Manage Subjects.
Each module has 4 operation toggles: Create, Read, Update, Delete.
Feature Access section exists with: My Notes, Academic Chats, Attendance, Reports & Analytics,
  Announcements, Exams, Collect Fees, Recent Payments, Transport Fees, Manage Parents,
  Bio-Metric, Finance Dashboard, Assignments, Fee Structure, Record Expenses.
Cancel and Create Manager buttons exist.
The Manager listing page shows Total Managers count and Blocked count.

1.2  The Gap — What Is Missing
Your current system has one flat manager type — every manager gets the same form. What is missing is the Manager Type Preset System: pre-defined button groups that auto-select related permissions, so admin can click 'Fees Manager' and all money-related features get pre-selected. Admin can then still fine-tune individual permissions. This is the entire scope of this document.
Already Built	What This Doc Adds	What It Does NOT Change
Create Manager form	Manager Type Preset Buttons	Existing form fields unchanged
Module Permissions (CRUD)	New manager_type column in DB	All existing feature toggles kept
Feature Access toggles	Type-based auto-selection logic	CRUD operations per module kept
Cancel / Create Manager	6 Manager Type cards UI	Backend auth middleware unchanged
Manager listing page	Type badge on manager cards	Role-based route protection kept

 
2.  Feature Classification — Which Features Need CRUD
Before defining manager types, every feature in your system must be classified: does it have CRUD operations (like Students, Faculty), or is it a feature access toggle (like Attendance, Finance Dashboard)?

#	Feature Name	Type	Create	Read	Update	Delete	Notes
1	Manage Students	CRUD Module	YES	YES	YES	YES	Already built
2	Manage Faculty	CRUD Module	YES	YES	YES	YES	Already built
3	Manage Classes	CRUD Module	YES	YES	YES	YES	Already built
4	Manage Subjects	CRUD Module	YES	YES	YES	YES	Already built
5	Fee Structure	CRUD Module	YES	YES	YES	YES	Add to form
6	Record Expenses	CRUD Module	YES	YES	YES	YES	Add to form
7	Manage Parents	CRUD Module	YES	YES	YES	YES	Add to form
8	Collect Fees	Feature Toggle	YES	YES	-	-	Collect + view only
9	Attendance	Feature Toggle	YES	YES	YES	-	Mark + edit + view
10	Exams	CRUD Module	YES	YES	YES	YES	Schedule + results
11	Announcements	CRUD Module	YES	YES	YES	YES	Post & manage
12	Assignments	CRUD Module	YES	YES	YES	YES	Create + grade
13	Transport Fees	CRUD Module	YES	YES	YES	YES	Routes + assign
14	Reports & Analytics	Feature Toggle	-	YES	-	-	View only
15	Finance Dashboard	Feature Toggle	-	YES	-	-	View only — limited
16	Recent Payments	Feature Toggle	-	YES	-	-	View only
17	Bio-Metric	Feature Toggle	-	YES	-	-	View device data
18	My Notes	Feature Toggle	YES	YES	YES	YES	Manager's own notes
19	Academic Chats	Feature Toggle	-	YES	-	-	Participate only

 
3.  The 6 Professional Manager Types
Based on the real-world structure of a coaching institute or school, all 19 features group naturally into 6 manager types. When admin clicks a type button, all relevant permissions are pre-selected but can still be individually adjusted before creating the manager.

💰  Fees Manager
Handles all money — fee collection, fee structures, transport fees, expenses. Cannot see revenue or profit/loss.

Feature / Module	Description	Create	Read	Update	Delete	Notes
Fee Structure	Create & manage fee plans	YES	YES	YES	YES	Full CRUD
Collect Fees	Collect student payments	YES	YES	-	-	Collect + view history
Record Expenses	Add & view institute expenses	YES	YES	YES	YES	Full CRUD
Transport Fees	Bus routes & student assignment	YES	YES	YES	YES	Full CRUD
Recent Payments	View payment records	- 	YES	-	-	View only — no edit
Finance Dashboard	View limited finance data	- 	YES	-	-	NO revenue/P&L access
Manage Parents	View parent payment contacts	- 	YES	-	-	Read only for contact

Fees Manager Restriction — Most Important
Fees Manager can NEVER see: Total Revenue, Profit/Loss, Total Salary paid, Monthly income.
Finance Dashboard shows only: Today's collections, Pending fees list, Recent receipts.
Backend must enforce this — frontend hiding alone is not enough.

📊  Data Manager
Handles all records and data entry — students, faculty, classes, subjects, parents. No financial access.

Feature / Module	Description	Create	Read	Update	Delete	Notes
Manage Students	Full student record management	YES	YES	YES	YES	Full CRUD
Manage Faculty	Full faculty record management	YES	YES	YES	YES	Full CRUD
Manage Classes	Create & manage class records	YES	YES	YES	YES	Full CRUD
Manage Subjects	Assign subjects to classes	YES	YES	YES	YES	Full CRUD
Manage Parents	Parent records & contacts	YES	YES	YES	YES	Full CRUD
Reports & Analytics	View student/attendance reports	- 	YES	-	-	View only
My Notes	Keep personal working notes	YES	YES	YES	YES	Manager's private notes

Data Manager Restriction
Data Manager has ZERO access to any financial feature.
Cannot see: Fee Collection, Expenses, Finance Dashboard, Recent Payments, Transport Fees.
Purpose: Suitable for office staff doing data entry and record management only.

📚  Academic Manager
Handles academics — attendance, exams, assignments, announcements, notes, academic chats.

Feature / Module	Description	Create	Read	Update	Delete	Notes
Attendance	Mark & manage attendance	YES	YES	YES	-	Cannot delete records
Exams	Schedule exams & enter marks	YES	YES	YES	YES	Full CRUD

Academic Chats	Participate in subject chats	YES	YES	YES	-	Cannot delete threads
My Notes	Keep teaching notes	YES	YES	YES	YES	Private notes
Manage Students	View student records only	- 	YES	-	-	Read only for reference
Manage Classes	View class info only	- 	YES	-	-	Read only for reference

Academic Manager Restriction
Academic Manager has NO financial access whatsoever.
Cannot create or edit Students/Faculty — only read for reference purposes.
Suitable for: Academic coordinators, department heads, senior teachers.

 
⚙️  Operations Manager
Handles day-to-day institute operations — announcements, transport, bio-metric, attendance, parents.

Feature / Module	Description	Create	Read	Update	Delete	Notes
Attendance	View & mark attendance	YES	YES	YES	-	Cannot delete
Announcements	Post operational announcements	YES	YES	YES	YES	Full CRUD

Collect Fees	Basic fee collection only	YES	YES	-	-	Collect + view, no edit

Operations Manager Use Case
Suitable for: Office superintendent, campus coordinator, admin assistant.
Has partial fee collection access but cannot see fee structures or expense records.
Can manage transport and biometric which are physical day-to-day operations.

👥  HR Manager
Handles people — faculty records, salary-adjacent info, attendance, parents. No student academics.

Feature / Module	Description	Create	Read	Update	Delete	Notes
Manage Faculty	Full faculty HR management	YES	YES	YES	YES	Full CRUD
Manage Parents	Parent records	YES	YES	YES	-	Cannot delete
Attendance	Track faculty attendance	YES	YES	YES	-	Cannot delete records
Reports & Analytics	HR & attendance reports	- 	YES	-	-	View only
Announcements	Post HR announcements	YES	YES	YES	YES	Full CRUD
My Notes	HR working notes	YES	YES	YES	YES	Private notes
Manage Students	View student records for context	- 	YES	-	-	Read only
Recent Payments	View salary payment records	- 	YES	-	-	View only — no edit

HR Manager Use Case
Suitable for: HR executive, faculty coordinator, staff management role.
Can view Recent Payments to track whether salaries were paid — cannot modify.
Has NO access to student fees, expense records, or finance dashboard.

🎛️  Custom Manager
Admin manually selects every single permission from scratch. No preset. Full flexibility.

The Custom Manager type does not pre-select any permissions. The admin sees the same existing form (already built in your screenshots) with all checkboxes empty. Admin picks exactly what this specific manager needs. This is the existing behavior of your current system — so no new backend work needed for Custom type, only a UI label.

5.  Database Changes
5.1  Add manager_type to users table
This is the only database change needed. Add one column to your existing users table:
ALTER TABLE users
  ADD COLUMN manager_type ENUM('fees','data','academic','ops','hr','custom')
  DEFAULT 'custom' AFTER role;

-- Also add a display label for the manager listing
ALTER TABLE users
  ADD COLUMN manager_type_label VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT NULL AFTER manager_type;
-- e.g. 'Fees Manager', 'Data Manager', etc.

5.2  No Other DB Changes Required
Your existing manager_permissions table (which stores the individual feature flags) does NOT need to change. The manager_type is just a label that tells the frontend which preset was used. The actual permissions are still stored per-manager in the existing permissions table/columns.
Why No New Permissions Table
Your current system already stores individual permissions per manager (seen in screenshots).
The manager_type column only records WHICH preset button the admin clicked.
This lets you show the type badge on the manager list ('Fees Manager', 'Data Manager').
The actual active permissions are still the individual toggles the admin confirmed.

 
6.  Backend Implementation — Phase by Phase
Phase 1	Add manager_type to User Model
Update Sequelize model to include the new column

In backend/models/user.js — add the new field:
// In your User Sequelize model — add these fields:
manager_type: {
  type: DataTypes.ENUM('fees','data','academic','ops','hr','custom'),
  defaultValue: 'custom',
  allowNull: true,
},
manager_type_label: {
  type: DataTypes.STRING(50),
  allowNull: true,
},

Phase 2	Update Create Manager Controller
Accept manager_type in request body

In your existing manager creation controller — add manager_type to the create logic. Do NOT rewrite the controller, just add these lines:
// In your existing createManager controller — add to the create call:
// (Find where you do User.create({...}) and add these two fields)

const MANAGER_TYPE_LABELS = {
  fees:     'Fees Manager',
  data:     'Data Manager',
  academic: 'Academic Manager',
  ops:      'Operations Manager',
  hr:       'HR Manager',
  custom:   'Custom Manager',
};

// In your User.create({}) call — add:
manager_type:       req.body.manager_type       || 'custom',
manager_type_label: MANAGER_TYPE_LABELS[req.body.manager_type] || 'Custom Manager',

Phase 3	Update Get Managers Controller
Return manager_type in list response

In your existing getManagers / listManagers controller — make sure manager_type and manager_type_label are included in the attributes returned:
// In your getManagers controller — ensure these are in attributes array:
attributes: [
  'id', 'name', 'email', 'phone', 'status',
  'manager_type',        // ADD THIS
  'manager_type_label',  // ADD THIS
  'created_at'
],

// The response will now include:
// { id:1, name:'Ravi Kumar', email:'...', manager_type:'fees',
//   manager_type_label:'Fees Manager', ... }

Phase 4	Update Manager Dashboard Middleware
Use manager_type to restrict Finance Dashboard data

This is the most important backend change. Your existing checkManagerPermission middleware already blocks features. But for Finance Dashboard, we need extra logic to limit what data is returned based on manager type:
// In your finance analytics controller — add this check:
// When manager requests Finance Dashboard, limit the data returned:

exports.getManagerFinanceDashboard = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { manager_type } = req.user;

    // Fees Manager gets LIMITED finance data (not P&L, not revenue totals)
    if (manager_type === 'fees') {
      const today = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0];
      const todayCollections = await StudentFee.sum('amount_paid', {
        where: { institute_id: req.user.institute_id,
                 payment_date: today, status: ['paid','partial'] }
      });
      const pendingList = await StudentFee.findAll({
        where: { institute_id: req.user.institute_id, status: ['pending','overdue'] },
        limit: 10, order: [['due_date','ASC']]
      });
      return res.json({ success:true, data: {
        today_collections: todayCollections || 0,
        pending_list:       pendingList,
        // NO: total_revenue, profit_loss, salary_totals
      }});
    }

    // Any other manager type with Finance Dashboard access gets same limited view
    return res.status(403).json({ success:false, message:'Access denied' });
  } catch(err) { res.status(500).json({ success:false, message:err.message }); }
};

 
7.  Frontend Implementation — Phase by Phase
Phase 5	Add Manager Type Preset Config File
Central config — auto-selected permissions per type

Create a new file frontend/src/config/managerPresets.js. This file defines which permissions each manager type pre-selects. This is the core logic of the entire feature:
// frontend/src/config/managerPresets.js

export const MANAGER_TYPES = [
  { id:'fees',     label:'Fees Manager',       emoji:'💰',
    color:'#16A34A', bg:'#F0FDF4', border:'#BBF7D0',
    description:'Handles fee collection, expenses, transport' },
  { id:'data',     label:'Data Manager',       emoji:'📊',
    color:'#2563EB', bg:'#EFF6FF', border:'#BFDBFE',
    description:'Manages students, faculty, classes, subjects' },
  { id:'academic', label:'Academic Manager',   emoji:'📚',

    color:'#D97706', bg:'#FFFBEB', border:'#FDE68A',
    description:'Day-to-day operations, transport, announcements' },
  { id:'hr',       label:'HR Manager',         emoji:'👥',
    color:'#0D9488', bg:'#F0FDFA', border:'#99F6E4',
    description:'Faculty HR, attendance tracking, parents' },
  { id:'custom',   label:'Custom Manager',     emoji:'🎛️',
    color:'#DB2777', bg:'#FDF2F8', border:'#FBCFE8',
    description:'Manually select all permissions from scratch' },
];

// Pre-selected permissions per type
// Each key matches the permission key in your existing form
export const MANAGER_PRESETS = {
  fees: {
    modules: {
      fee_structure: { enabled:true,  create:true,  read:true,  update:true,  delete:true  },
      expenses:      { enabled:true,  create:true,  read:true,  update:true,  delete:true  },
      transport:     { enabled:true,  create:true,  read:true,  update:true,  delete:true  },
      parents:       { enabled:true,  create:false, read:true,  update:false, delete:false },
    },
    features: {
      collect_fees:       true,
      recent_payments:    true,
      finance_dashboard:  true,  // limited view
      my_notes:           true,
    }
  },
  data: {
    modules: {
      students:  { enabled:true, create:true, read:true, update:true, delete:true },
      faculty:   { enabled:true, create:true, read:true, update:true, delete:true },
      classes:   { enabled:true, create:true, read:true, update:true, delete:true },
      subjects:  { enabled:true, create:true, read:true, update:true, delete:true },
      parents:   { enabled:true, create:true, read:true, update:true, delete:true },
    },
    features: {
      reports_analytics: true,
      my_notes:          true,
    }
  },

      exams:       { enabled:true, create:true,  read:true, update:true,  delete:true  },
      assignments: { enabled:true, create:true,  read:true, update:true,  delete:true  },

    },
    features: {
      attendance:    true,
      bio_metric:    true,
      collect_fees:  true,
      my_notes:      true,
      reports_analytics: true,
    }
  },
  hr: {
    modules: {
      faculty:      { enabled:true, create:true,  read:true, update:true, delete:true  },
      students:     { enabled:true, create:false, read:true, update:false,delete:false },
      parents:      { enabled:true, create:true,  read:true, update:true, delete:false },
      announcements:{ enabled:true, create:true,  read:true, update:true, delete:true  },
    },
    features: {
      attendance:        true,
      recent_payments:   true,
      reports_analytics: true,
      my_notes:          true,
    }
  },
  custom: {}  // no presets — empty — user selects manually
};

Phase 6	Add Manager Type Selector to Create Manager Form
Add type buttons ABOVE the form — clicking auto-fills permissions

In your existing CreateManager modal / form component, add the Manager Type selector at the top, before the name/email fields. This is a new UI section that sits above the existing form:
// In your existing CreateManager.jsx — add at the TOP of the form:
import { MANAGER_TYPES, MANAGER_PRESETS } from '../../config/managerPresets';

const [selectedType, setSelectedType]       = useState('custom');
const [permissions,  setPermissions]         = useState({});

// When admin clicks a type button
const handleTypeSelect = (typeId) => {
  setSelectedType(typeId);
  if (typeId === 'custom') {
    setPermissions({});  // reset all — admin picks manually
    return;
  }
  // Apply preset permissions
  const preset = MANAGER_PRESETS[typeId];
  setPermissions(preset);
  // The existing checkboxes should now reflect the preset state
};

// ── Type Selector UI ──────────────────────────────────
// Add this ABOVE your existing form fields (name, email, etc.)
<div style={{ marginBottom:24 }}>
  <h4 style={{ margin:'0 0 12px', color:'#1E3A5F' }}>
    Select Manager Type
  </h4>
  <div style={{ display:'grid', gridTemplateColumns:'repeat(3,1fr)', gap:10 }}>
    {MANAGER_TYPES.map(type => (
      <button key={type.id}
        onClick={() => handleTypeSelect(type.id)}
        style={{
          padding:'12px 10px',
          border: selectedType===type.id
            ? `2px solid ${type.color}`
            : '2px solid #E2E8F0',
          borderRadius:10,
          background: selectedType===type.id ? type.bg : '#fff',
          cursor:'pointer',
          textAlign:'center',
          transition:'all 0.15s',
        }}>
        <div style={{ fontSize:22 }}>{type.emoji}</div>
        <div style={{ fontWeight:600, fontSize:13,
             color: selectedType===type.id ? type.color : '#374151',
             marginTop:4 }}>
          {type.label}
        </div>
        <div style={{ fontSize:11, color:'#6B7280', marginTop:2 }}>
          {type.description}
        </div>
      </button>
    ))}
  </div>
</div>

Phase 7	Wire Preset Permissions to Existing Checkboxes
Auto-check boxes when type is selected

Your existing checkbox components need to read from the permissions state that was set by the preset. This is a small change to your existing checkbox rendering logic:
// In your existing module permission checkbox rendering:
// Find where you render Create/Read/Update/Delete checkboxes
// and update the 'checked' value to also check the preset state

// BEFORE (your current code — approximate):
checked={localPermissions[module]?.create}

// AFTER (add preset-awareness):
checked={
  permissions?.modules?.[module]?.create  // from preset
  ?? localPermissions[module]?.create      // from manual selection
  ?? false
}

// Similarly for features:
// BEFORE:
checked={selectedFeatures.includes('attendance')}

// AFTER:
checked={
  permissions?.features?.attendance   // from preset
  ?? selectedFeatures.includes('attendance')  // manual
}

// Admin can still click any checkbox to override after type selection
// onChange handler remains the same — it updates localPermissions

Phase 8	Pass manager_type in Create Manager API call
Send selected type to backend

In your existing handleCreateManager / form submit function, add manager_type to the request body. This is a one-line addition:
// In your existing createManager API call — add manager_type:
// Find your api.post('/managers', ...) or similar call

// BEFORE (your existing submit):
const res = await api.post('/managers', {
  name, email, phone, password, permissions
});

// AFTER — add manager_type:
const res = await api.post('/managers', {
  name, email, phone, password,
  manager_type: selectedType,      // ADD THIS LINE
  permissions
});

Phase 9	Show Manager Type Badge on Manager List
Display colored type badge on each manager card

In your existing Manager listing page, show a colored type badge next to each manager name. Find where you render manager cards/rows and add:
// In your manager list rendering — add type badge:
import { MANAGER_TYPES } from '../../config/managerPresets';

const TypeBadge = ({ managerType }) => {
  const type = MANAGER_TYPES.find(t => t.id === managerType) || MANAGER_TYPES[5];
  return (
    <span style={{
      background: type.bg,
      color:      type.color,
      border:     `1px solid ${type.border}`,
      padding:    '3px 10px',
      borderRadius: 20,
      fontSize:   12,
      fontWeight: 600,
    }}>
      {type.emoji} {type.label}
    </span>
  );
};

// In your manager list/table row:
<TypeBadge managerType={manager.manager_type} />

 
8.  Validations & Edge Cases
8.1  Frontend Validations
#	Scenario	Rule	Error / Action
1	Admin selects Fees Manager type then unchecks all	Allow — type is just a preset	No error — custom selection valid
2	Admin selects Custom type and submits with 0 permissions	Block empty custom manager	'Select at least one permission'
3	Admin creates manager without selecting type	Default to Custom	Auto-set type = custom, proceed
4	Admin changes type after already selecting permissions	Confirm dialog before overwriting	'Switching type will reset permissions. Continue?'
5	Admin grants Finance Dashboard to Data Manager	Allow — preset is just a default	No error — admin has override right
6	Two managers created with same email	Email must be unique	'Email already in use'
7	Password less than 6 characters	Min 6 chars — already in your form	'Min 6 characters' — already built

8.2  Backend Security Rules
#	Rule	Implementation
1	manager_type must be valid ENUM	Sequelize ENUM validation rejects invalid values automatically
2	Fees Manager Finance Dashboard — limited data only	Separate endpoint getManagerFinanceDashboard() returns only today_collections and pending_list
3	manager_type cannot be changed via API	Add manager_type to the list of non-editable fields in update controller
4	Only Admin can create managers	allowRoles('admin') on POST /managers — already in your system
5	manager_type not exposed on manager's own JWT payload	JWT payload contains role, institute_id, id. manager_type fetched from DB per request

 
9.  Complete Implementation Checklist
Phase	Area	Task	Notes
1	Database	ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN manager_type ENUM(...)	Run SQL once in MySQL
1	Database	ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN manager_type_label VARCHAR(50)	Run SQL once in MySQL
2	Backend	Add manager_type field to User Sequelize model	models/user.js

Final Summary — Minimal Changes, Maximum Impact
Total new files: 1  (managerPresets.js config file)
Total new DB columns: 2  (manager_type, manager_type_label on users table)
Total new backend endpoints: 1  (getManagerFinanceDashboard for Fees Manager)
Total changes to existing files: 4  (user model, create controller, list controller, CreateManager.jsx)
Everything else in your current Manager System stays exactly as is.
The preset system is purely additive — it only pre-checks boxes for convenience.
Admin still has full override — can check/uncheck any permission after selecting a type.
